# aws-data-sets
Here are two data sets that we can use in our project. One is tracking the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries and individuals tested for the virus, and the other includes data on numbers of licensed beds, staffed beds, ICU beds, and the bed utilization rate for the hospitals in the United States.

# Usage
We can use these data sets to show that the situation of covid is urgent, so we want to develop a tool to help doctors diagnose covid19 and distinguish between covid and other diseases such as pneumonia, breast cancer, or brain tumor based on x-ray images.
