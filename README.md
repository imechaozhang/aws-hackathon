# Why we are doing this
Covid-19 is killing a lot of people, as in the table below

### Covid19 cases for top 10 countries (to date 08-12-2020)
United States     5172216
Brazil            3164785
India             2329638
Russia             895691
South Africa       566109
Mexico             492522
Peru               489680
Colombia           410453
Chile              376616
Iran               331189

More importantly, the infecting curve is not flattening even after half a year, so we need to prepare for fighting with it for a long time. Hospitals would not be able to focus on this single disease, instead covid19 patients will be mixed with patients with all kinds of diseases. So it would be helpful to have a tool that distinguishes covid19 from other diseases. Given that one important step for covid19 diagnosis is x-ray scan, we developed a model that distinguishes different diseases including covid19, pneumonia, breast cancer, and brain tumor. (more can be integrated in future) We believe this tool can help doctors diagnose covid19 and other diseases from x-ray scans in seconds.
